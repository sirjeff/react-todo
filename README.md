## ToDo App in React
A basic and useable 'to do' list as a demo for React.
This app uses React as the base for interaction and dynamic rendering

### Technologies
- react-app 0.1.0
- create-react-app 1.5.2
- npm 6.10.2
- Bootstrap 4.1.1
- Axios 0.19.0

### Requirements
- npm (for dev server and to compile code)
- web server (if going external)
- new browser
-- tested and developed with Vivaldi 2.9
-- IE 11 and under, does not work
-- Chromium based browsers (Opera, Chrome, Vivaldi) should all work
-- FireFox 71+ is good
-- Otter browsers ... useless

### DB Storage
External proxy DB via OMI, built in Perl and uses Perl DBI to access MySQL
Access is granted via this app.


### Future plans
- priorities value, can drag items around (sorder)
- user login to save own lists etc
- add groups or categories (shopping-list, today, camping-trip)
